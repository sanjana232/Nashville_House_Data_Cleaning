Situation:
I was tasked with cleaning a dataset that had multiple issues, such as inconsistencies in data formats, missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns. The data in its raw form was unsuitable for analysis or reporting. Ensuring that the data was clean and well-organized was critical for accurate downstream analysis and decision-making.

Task:
The objective was to clean the dataset using SQL. This involved tasks such as standardizing date formats, handling missing values, breaking down addresses into individual columns, renaming columns, removing duplicates, and deleting irrelevant columns. The goal was to transform the raw, unstructured data into a structured and clean format that could be easily analyzed.

Action:
I implemented the data cleaning process using the following SQL steps:

Standardizing Date Formats:

I standardized the date formats across the dataset to ensure consistency. This likely involved using SQL functions to convert dates to a common format.
Handling Missing Values:

I identified and handled missing values, possibly by filling them in with default values, using previous entries, or flagging them for further inspection.
Breaking Down Addresses:

I broke down complex address fields into individual components, such as street, city, state, and postal code, making it easier to filter and analyze location data.
Renaming Columns:

I renamed columns to more meaningful and consistent names, improving readability and ensuring that column names followed a standardized naming convention.
Removing Duplicates:

I identified and removed duplicate rows from the dataset to prevent redundant data from skewing the results of any analysis.
Deleting Irrelevant Columns:

I removed columns that were unnecessary or irrelevant to the analysis, reducing clutter and focusing on the most pertinent data.
Result:
The result of the work was a clean, well-structured dataset that was ready for analysis. By standardizing formats, filling in missing values, and removing inconsistencies, you ensured that the data was reliable and accurate. This clean dataset could now be used for meaningful analysis, leading to better insights and more informed decision-making.
